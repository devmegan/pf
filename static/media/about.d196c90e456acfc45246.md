## 👋 Hello world

I'm a Web Developer with hands-on experience in dev teams at first, second and third sector organisations.

From blue light services and government departments to registered charities and florists, I've worked with a smorgasbord of languages and frameworks, and delivered solutions that made an impact.

I'm interested in performance related technologies and enhancements. My team's current website is the [fastest charity website to Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://github.com/devmegan/portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/doc/salience-report.pdf?raw=true) in the UK 😎 and we have the [lowest First Input Delay (FID) too](https://github.com/devmegan/portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/doc/salience-report.pdf?raw=true)!

On the front-end I'm confident developing against design systems and to WCAG guidelines, [shifting-left](https://www.deque.com/shift-left-testing-solutions/) on those accessibility considerations during design phases.

The last few years have been strongly focused on React and Symfony, but I still stumble across Backbone and Zend files every now and again. The coolest tool I've picked up over the past year is writing Makefiles 🧙.

Before moving into writing commercial software, I studied political philosophy at the Vrije Universitiet Amsterdam. It was adapting the [Amsterdam Content Analysis Tool](https://github.com/amcat) that opened up a journey into software development for me.

Interested in talking? Download [my CV](https://github.com/devmegan/portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/doc/megan-molloy-cv.pdf?raw=true) and [connect with me online](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devmegan/). I'm always happy to rabbit about tech, philosophy, and rivers. Peace! ✌️
