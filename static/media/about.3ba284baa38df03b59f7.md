## üëã Hello world

I'm a Web Developer with hands-on experience in dev teams at first, second and third sector organisations.

From blue light services and government departments to registered charities and florists, I've worked with a smorgasboard of languages and frameworks, and delivered solutions that made an impact.

I'm interested in performance related technologies and enhancements. My team's current website is the [fastest charity website to Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://github.com/devmegan/portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/doc/salience-report.pdf?raw=true) in the UK üòé and we have the [lowest First Input Delay (FID) too](https://github.com/devmegan/portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/doc/salience-report.pdf?raw=true)!

On the front-end I'm confident developing to WCAG guidelines and shifting-left on those accessibility considerations during design phases. I've been using [storybook's interaction testing](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/interaction-testing) to make sure there's practical accessibility testing in place, in addition to using a11y linting and axe devtools.

The last few years have been heavily focused on React and Symfony, but I still stumble across Backbone and Zend files every now and again. One of my favourite tools I've picked up over the past year is writing Makefiles üßô.

Before moving into writing commercial software, I studied political philosophy at the Vrije Universitiet Amsterdam. It was adapting the [Amsterdam Content Analysis Tool](https://github.com/amcat) that opened up a journey into software development for me.
