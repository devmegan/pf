## 👋 Hello world

I'm a Web Developer with hands-on experience in dev teams at first, second and third sector organisations.

From blue light services and government departments to registered charities and florists, I've worked with a smorgasboard of languages and frameworks, and delivered solutions that made an impact.

I'm interested in performance related technologies and enhancements. My team's current website is the [fastest charity website to Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](/salience-charities-report-2022.pdf#page=15) in the UK 😎 and we have the [lowest First Input Delay (FID) too](/salience-charities-report-2022.pdf#page=14)!

On the front-end I'm confident developing to WCAG guidelines and shifting-left on those accessibility considerations during design phases.

I've become well aquanited with React and Symfony ecosystems over the last few years, but I still stumble across a Backbone file every now and again.
